## UX

### Project Purpose

The main goal of the Simon game is to provide a fun and challenging experience to users of all ages.

### Player Experience

- Should a player get stuck, there is a *'rules and intructions'* button in the top left.

### User Stories

- #### As a player, I'd like to see:
    - Easy and simple controls.
    - Different colours for each pad included with sound.
    - A Rule and Instruction window how to play the game.
    - Different 'Strict' button to increase the difficulty.

## Features

### Excisting Features

- *Power Slider -* <br> 
A simple slider to turn the game ON or OFF.
It will turn basic green to see that you've put the button on ON.

- *Coloured Pads -* <br>
4 Basic (abit darker) color pads like the same simon game.<br>
All pads have a CSS hover style, so the player could easily see which pad they are going to press.

- *Start Button -* <br>
A start button which is changing in color when you turn the power ON. <br>
With the change in color you are able to see that the game is ready to play.

- *Count Display -* <br> 
A simple box with a red border and black background with a text color of red. <br>
Added a box-shadow to it so when the Power is on you see a little glow on it.

- *Strict Slider -* <br>
A slider button to turn the strict option ON or OFF. <br>
Its a different color from the Power button to see the differences between both buttons.

- *Rules and Instruction button -* <br>
A modal button in the top left. <br>
This will open the rules and instructions with a clear rules and instructions.

    - Select - *Joeri157/Milestone-Project-SimonGame* - from the list of repositories.
    - Select - *Settings* - from the navbar near the top right side.
    - Scroll down to where it says - *Github Pages* -
    - There you will find - *Source* -
    - Click on the button and select - *master branch* -
    - After you've set it on *master branch* the page will automatically load again.
    - If you open it right away you will see an **Error404**.
    - This progress before the site goes live will take a couple of minutes.

- To add this repository to your local workspace:
    - Click on the [Simon Game repository on GitHub!](https://joeri157.github.io/Milestone-Project-SimonGame/) link.
    - Select the green button on the right-hand side named **Clone or download** and copy the clone URL.
    - Go into your local workspace and open up a new terminal (git bash).
    - You will need to be inside of the directory that you want to add the cloning to.
    - Type `git clone ` and paste the URL you copied from GitHub and press enter. It should look like this:
